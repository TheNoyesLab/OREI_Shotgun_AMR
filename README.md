# OREI Teat Shotgun Metagenomics AMR Analysis

A repo dedicated to metegenome/resistome analyses of Shotgun sequencing of teat swabs of calving cows from four Farms, with some of the cows testing positive for Staphyloccocus aureus infection.

## Analyses/Figures so far include: 
- AMR Classification relative abundance barplot
- Principal Components Analysis (visualizing cow health statuses)
- **PERMANOVA Testing**
  - Days in Milk, S. aureus infection, Batch effects
- Time Series Differential Abundance (metagenomeseq) _WIP_
- **AMR Differential Abundance Testing** (ALDEX2)
